# üóÇÔ∏è Task Management System

A full-stack **Task Management System** with **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** built using:

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript, MongoDB, Passport (JWT & Local)
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, TanStack Query, Radix UI

This project allows **ADMIN** and **MEMBER** to manage tasks with distinct permissions and secure authentication.

---

## üë• Roles & Permissions

### üîπ Admin
- Create, edit, and delete members  
- Create, edit, and delete tasks  
- View all members and all tasks  

### üîπ Member
- View only their own tasks  
- Create and edit their own tasks  

---

## üßæ User Registration & Role Assignment

- When a **new user registers**, they are automatically assigned the **`MEMBER`** role by default.  
- To make a user an **ADMIN**, you must **manually update their role** in the database for now.
- This project uses MongoDB Transactions for consistent multi-document operations (for example, creating related        records in one atomic action).Therefore, the backend only works correctly with MongoDB Atlas (or a local replica set).

### üß© Backend
- **Express.js** for RESTful APIs  
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** for data modeling  
- **Passport.js (JWT & Local)** for authentication  
- **bcryptjs** for password hashing  
- **dotenv** for environment configuration
